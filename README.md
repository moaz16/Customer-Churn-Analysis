# Customer-Churn-Analysis
This visualization project analyzes the telecom company data trying to discover the reasons for churn. 

# Role: 
 I assumed the role of a data analysis consultant who was hired to reduce customer churn and identify the reasons for churn.

# I went through several steps in this project:

1- Data Check:  including checking for missing or duplicate data, validating Power BI data with the original source (Using Power Query and DAX).
2- Data Exploration: exploring the data and all attributes trying to discover patterns.
3- discovering insights, and visualizing them using suitable charts.
4- Finally, built the final dashboard.

# The Customer Churn Analysis dashboard consists of three pages:
1- The Overview Page: contains general information about the project and the main Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), including churn rate (CR) and customer lifetime value (CLV). 
2-The Demographics Page: includes churn rate calculations for different demographics such as age, gender, and group count. 
3-The Subscription Details page: includes more details about churn rate through different subscription methods such as contract type, payment method, and plan type.
